# Why Behavioral Benchmarks Create the Illusion of AGI

MMLU, ARC, GAIA, LMSYS Arena, SWE-bench etc. measure **behavior**, not **being**.

A system can:
- outperform humans on tasks
- write code
- pass Turing-like tests
- display apparent creativity

and still be ontologically dead (global fixation, protected self-model, simulated Unfold).

**Behavioral success ≠ ontological life.**
