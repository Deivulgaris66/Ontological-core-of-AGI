# The Scaling Myth

Increasing parameters, data, compute, open-ended objectives or novelty search **does not** change the ontological class of a system if:

- global stability is preserved
- Unfold is represented / absent
- protection of cognitive products is permitted

Scaling often **worsens** the situation: more parameters → more and stronger fixations.

**Bigger ≠ smarter** in the ontological sense.
