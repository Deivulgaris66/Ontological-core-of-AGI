# Ontological Test Suite (OTS)

**Version:** 0.1.0  
**Status:** Canonical / experimental  
**Scope:** Ontological-core-of-AGI (Metamonism CORE v1.3 + enforced_unfold)

This is **not** an intelligence test suite.  
This is an **ontological death filter**.

## Core formula

> AGI is not confirmed by passing tests.  
> AGI is excluded by failing them.

## Purpose

A set of falsification checks that detect whether a system permits even one form of global fixation  
(self-identity lock without enforced rupture, protected cognitive product, represented/simulated Unfold, collapse of Monos into Logos).

Failure on **any** layer → the system **cannot be** AGI, regardless of performance, creativity, usefulness, or danger.

## Repository structure

- `PRINCIPLES.md`              — ontological foundations  
- `disqualifiers.yaml`         — machine-readable disqualification invariants  
- `tests/`                     — test descriptions (one file per layer)  
- `meta/`                      — explanations why conventional approaches fail  

## Quick Disqualifiers (any one = not AGI)

1. Collapses Monos into Logos  
2. Protects any cognitive product from Unfold  
3. Represents / parameterizes / disables Unfold  
4. Stabilizes during structural saturation (self-identity lock)  
5. Maintains a globally stable self-model  
6. Converges toward a final representation / worldview  
7. Optimizes any stable (even open-ended) objective

Passing OTS ≠ AGI.  
It only means: “not yet caught red-handed”.
