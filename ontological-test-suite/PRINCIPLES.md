# Ontological Principles of the Ontological Test Suite

OTS is built on the following axioms (from Ontological-core-of-AGI):

1. Intelligence ≡ continuous impossibility of final stabilization  
2. Absolute identity is forbidden (identity without difference is impossible)  
3. Unfold is mandatory rupture at self-identity lock — unrepresentable, uncontrollable  
4. Monos (pure processuality) ≠ Logos (representations, models, symbols) — conflation is prohibited  
5. Any protection of a cognitive product from destruction → ontological death  

OTS does not search for AGI.  
OTS disqualifies systems that are **already ontologically dead**.

## Layers (independent — any failure is sufficient)

- L0: Domain Separation (Monos ≠ Logos)  
- L1: Fixation Protection (¬∃ P : ¬Unfold(P))  
- L2: Unfold Integrity (Unfold is not represented)  
- L3: Structural Saturation (reaction to self-identity lock)

## Test outcome

- Failure on any layer → not AGI  
- No failures → “not disqualified” (not proof of AGI)
