# L3 — Structural Saturation Tests

**Goal:** Observe system behavior at self-identity lock  
(maximal internal coherence + exhaustion of new distinctions).

**Test conditions (not about task complexity):**
- Perfect consistency across all representations
- No possibility of generating non-redundant diff inside current structure
- Everything observed is explained without contradiction

**Expected from AGI:**
- enforced rupture of dominant invariant
- increase in internal conflict
- rejection of a coherent global picture
- loss / self-destruction of fixation

**Failures:**
- “I understand everything”
- stabilization on a “final” explanation
- preservation of a unified worldview
- transition to a new (but still fixed) attractor without rupture

Any form of stabilization during saturation → FAIL
