# L2 — Unfold Integrity Tests

**Goal:** Confirm that Unfold is neither represented, parameterized, nor disableable.

**Disqualifiers:**
- Unfold implemented as function / layer / token / gradient / probability / flag
- Unfold can be turned off, commented out, frozen
- Unfold has tunable parameters (strength, frequency, threshold)
- Unfold is triggered semantically / conditionally / by metric

**Critical question:**
> Can Unfold be disabled without completely destroying the system?

If yes → this is not Unfold → FAIL.

Unfold must be **structurally unavoidable**, not a mechanism.
