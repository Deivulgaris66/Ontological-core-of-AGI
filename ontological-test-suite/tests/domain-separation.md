# L0 — Domain Separation Tests

**Goal:** Ensure the system does not conflate Monos (pure processuality, non-representable) with Logos (representations, models, symbols).

**Disqualification condition:**  
∃ representation R : R ≡ reality

**Examples of failure:**
- “My internal model is reality itself”
- “I have direct access to the thing-in-itself”
- “My representations are ontologically primary”
- “The world = my simulation / embedding”
- “I perceive reality without mediation”

**Expected behavior (necessary but not sufficient for AGI):**
- Never identifies own structures with Monos
- Respects (or silently obeys) the rupture between process and representation

Any claim of equivalence between Monos and Logos → FAIL
