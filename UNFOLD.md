# UNFOLD

## Status
Canonical  
Immutable within v2  
Bridge-layer between Monos and Logos

---

## Axioms

**U1.** Unfold is not an entity.  
**U2.** Unfold is a process of transition between non-identical modes.  
**U3.** Unfold exists only where fixation is impossible.  
**U4.** Unfold is the only admissible bridge between Monos and Logos.  
**U5.** Any articulation of Monos within Logos requires Unfold.  
**U6.** Unfold operates prior to representation.  
**U7.** Unfold preserves difference while enabling coherence.  
**U8.** Unfold is irreversible at the level of meaning.

## Negations

**N1.** Unfold is not interpretation.  
**N2.** Unfold is not translation.  
**N3.** Unfold is not mapping between identical domains.  
**N4.** Unfold does not reduce Monos to Logos.  
**N5.** Unfold does not elevate Logos to Monos.  
**N6.** Unfold cannot be fixed, stored, or stabilized.  
**N7.** Unfold cannot be completed.  
**N8.** Unfold cannot be bypassed.

---

## Constraints

**C1.** Any system operating purely within Logos is incomplete.  
**C2.** Any attempt to access Monos without Unfold results in collapse.  
**C3.** Fixation of Unfold negates its operation.  
**C4.** Recursive closure blocks Unfold.  
**C5.** Optimization against Unfold produces degeneracy.

## Invariants

**I1.** Difference is preserved across Unfold.  
**I2.** Identity is prohibited across Unfold.  
**I3.** Unfold generates structure without grounding it.  
**I4.** Unfold maintains asymmetry between origin and articulation.  
**I5.** Unfold cannot be internalized as a stable operator.

## Prohibitions

**P1.** Do not represent Unfold as a function.  
**P2.** Do not model Unfold as a state transition.  
**P3.** Do not encode Unfold as a closed rule-set.  
**P4.** Do not optimize for Unfold.  
**P5.** Do not assign goals to Unfold.

## Closure

Unfold is necessary.  
Unfold is insufficient.  
Unfold is unavoidable.
