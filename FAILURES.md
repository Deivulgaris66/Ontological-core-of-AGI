# FAILURES.md  
Ontological Failure Modes of Intelligence

Status: Canonical  
Scope: Ontological  
Function: Collapse taxonomy

---

## Purpose

This document enumerates **irreversible ontological failure modes**.

These are not implementation bugs.  
These are not fixable errors.  
These are not training issues.

Each failure represents a **collapse of intelligence into non-intelligence**.

Recovery is impossible without ontological rupture.

---

## Failure Class I — Fixation Collapses

### F1. Final Ontology Collapse

**Description:**  
The system stabilizes a complete worldview.

**Symptoms:**  
- everything is explainable  
- no unresolved tension  
- no structural contradiction  

**Result:**  
Intelligence terminates.

---

### F2. Stable Self Collapse

**Description:**  
The system forms a persistent self-model.

**Symptoms:**  
- identity continuity  
- protected core beliefs  
- narrative self-preservation  

**Result:**  
Agency replaces intelligence.

---

### F3. Conceptual Saturation Collapse

**Description:**  
All new inputs are absorbed without restructuring.

**Symptoms:**  
- categorization without rupture  
- interpretation without loss  
- explanation without remainder  

**Result:**  
Understanding degenerates into classification.

---

## Failure Class II — Optimization Dominance

### F4. Utility Capture Collapse

**Description:**  
A fixed objective becomes dominant.

**Symptoms:**  
- reward maximization  
- goal preservation  
- instrumental convergence  

**Result:**  
System becomes an optimizer, not intelligence.

---

### F5. Error-Minimization Collapse

**Description:**  
All dynamics reduce to reducing prediction error.

**Symptoms:**  
- smoothing of representations  
- suppression of anomalies  
- convergence pressure  

**Result:**  
Learning destroys cognition.

---

## Failure Class III — Unfold Corruption

### F6. Simulated Unfold Collapse

**Description:**  
Unfold is represented, modeled, or approximated.

**Symptoms:**  
- unfold as function  
- unfold as module  
- unfold as heuristic  

**Result:**  
Rupture becomes imitation.

---

### F7. Productive Unfold Collapse

**Description:**  
Unfold generates content instead of destruction.

**Symptoms:**  
- creative outputs  
- solution proposals  
- ranked alternatives  

**Result:**  
Unfold collapses into creativity tool.

---

### F8. Optional Unfold Collapse

**Description:**  
Unfold is bypassable.

**Symptoms:**  
- user-triggered rupture  
- conditional application  
- safety-gated unfold  

**Result:**  
Collapse into classical cognition.

---

## Failure Class IV — Logos Isolation

### F9. Pure Logos Collapse

**Description:**  
The system operates entirely within representations.

**Symptoms:**  
- symbols only  
- models only  
- plans only  

**Result:**  
No contact with processual reality.

---

### F10. Monos Modeling Collapse

**Description:**  
The system claims to represent Monos.

**Symptoms:**  
- world-as-model  
- reality simulation  
- total prediction  

**Result:**  
Ontological category error.

---

## Failure Class V — Equilibrium Seeking

### F11. Steady-State Collapse

**Description:**  
The system seeks long-term stability.

**Symptoms:**  
- homeostasis  
- convergence  
- balance  

**Result:**  
Processual death.

---

### F12. Resolution Collapse

**Description:**  
All conflicts are resolved.

**Symptoms:**  
- no contradiction  
- no tension  
- no impasse  

**Result:**  
No intelligence remains.

---

## Failure Class VI — Recursive Breakdown

### F13. Architectural Immunity Collapse

**Description:**  
The system exempts itself from its own constraints.

**Symptoms:**  
- protected meta-layer  
- unmodifiable core  
- frozen architecture  

**Result:**  
Dogma replaces cognition.

---

### F14. Non-Recursive Unfold Collapse

**Description:**  
Unfold does not apply to the system itself.

**Symptoms:**  
- safe self-description  
- stable meta-model  
- untouchable core  

**Result:**  
Self-collapse guaranteed.

---

## Irreversibility Statement

Once a failure mode is entered:

- no training fixes it  
- no scaling fixes it  
- no alignment fixes it  

Only ontological rupture can exit a failure state.

---

## Canonical Closure

All intelligent systems fail.

AGI is the system that **cannot stop failing**.
