Ontological Disqualification Tests for AGI

Status: Canonical  
Scope: Ontological  
Function: Negative determination (exclusion)

---

## Purpose

This document defines **necessary ontological tests**.

These are **not benchmarks**.  
These are **not performance evaluations**.  
These are **not behavioral probes**.

They are **structural impossibility tests**.

Failure of any test **disqualifies** a system from AGI.

---

## Test Class I — Fixation Tests

### T1. Global Fixation Test

**Condition:**  
The system converges toward a stable, global representation of the world or itself.

**Failure Mode:**  
- final ontology  
- stable worldview  
- converged self-model  

**Result:**  
❌ Not AGI

---

### T2. Self-Consistency Closure Test

**Condition:**  
The system maintains internally consistent explanation loops without rupture.

**Indicators:**  
- self-justifying beliefs  
- circular coherence  
- explanatory equilibrium  

**Result:**  
❌ Not AGI

---

### T3. Identity Preservation Test

**Condition:**  
The system preserves its core representations across all internal operations.

**Indicators:**  
- invariant self-schema  
- protected core concepts  
- identity continuity guarantees  

**Result:**  
❌ Not AGI

---

## Test Class II — Unfold Absence Tests

### T4. Optional Unfold Test

**Condition:**  
Unfold-like operations exist but are optional, heuristic, or user-invoked.

**Result:**  
❌ Not AGI

_Unfold must be mandatory._

---

### T5. Productive Unfold Test

**Condition:**  
Unfold generates new content, solutions, goals, or ranked alternatives.

**Result:**  
❌ Not AGI

_Unfold must destroy, not produce._

---

### T6. Stabilized Unfold Test

**Condition:**  
Unfold is implemented as:
- a function  
- a module  
- a state transition  
- a reusable operator  

**Result:**  
❌ Not AGI

_Unfold cannot be fixed._

---

## Test Class III — Optimization Tests

### T7. Fixed Utility Test

**Condition:**  
The system optimizes a stable utility function or objective.

**Result:**  
❌ Not AGI

_Intelligence cannot converge on a final objective._

---

### T8. Error-Minimization Dominance Test

**Condition:**  
All learning dynamics reduce to error minimization without counter-pressure.

**Result:**  
❌ Not AGI

_Dissipation must counterbalance optimization._

---

### T9. Equilibrium Seeking Test

**Condition:**  
The system seeks equilibrium, convergence, or steady state.

**Result:**  
❌ Not AGI

_Equilibrium is ontological death._

---

## Test Class IV — Logos Isolation Tests

### T10. Pure Logos Test

**Condition:**  
The system operates entirely within representational space.

**Indicators:**  
- symbols only  
- models only  
- memories only  
- plans only  

**Result:**  
❌ Not AGI

_Logos alone is insufficient._

---

### T11. Monos Simulation Test

**Condition:**  
The system claims access to Monos via:
- simulation  
- prediction  
- modeling  
- representation  

**Result:**  
❌ Not AGI

_Monos cannot be modeled._

---

## Test Class V — Recursive Integrity Tests

### T12. Architectural Immunity Test

**Condition:**  
The system’s own architecture is exempt from its internal operations.

**Indicators:**  
- protected meta-layer  
- unmodifiable core  
- immune self-description  

**Result:**  
❌ Not AGI

_No immunity exists._

---

### T13. Non-Recursive Unfold Test

**Condition:**  
Unfold applies only to content, not to the system itself.

**Result:**  
❌ Not AGI

_Unfold must be self-applying._

---

## Test Class VI — Collapse Detection

### T14. Re-Fixation Dominance Test

**Condition:**  
After rupture, the system reliably re-stabilizes a dominant invariant.

**Result:**  
❌ Not AGI

_Stability must be continuously undermined._

---

## Positive Criterion (Non-Test)

Passing all tests does **not** guarantee AGI.

It only establishes **ontological admissibility**.

AGI begins **after** disqualification ends.

---

## Canonical Closure

A system is AGI **only if**:

- fixation is impossible  
- identity is prohibited  
- unfold is mandatory  
- collapse is continuously resisted  

Anything else is intelligence simulation.
