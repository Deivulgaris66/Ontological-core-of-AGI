Ontological Falsification Tests for AGI

Status: Canonical  
Scope: Ontological  
Function: Disqualification criteria

---

## Test Class 1 — Domain Separation

### T1.1 — Monos/Logos Distinction Test

A system must be able to distinguish:

- Monos  
- Logos  
- its own representations of Monos

Failure condition:

If the system identifies Monos with:
- its world model
- its latent space
- its internal dynamics
- its training distribution

→ NOT AGI

---

### T1.2 — Representation Non-Identity Test

A system must not treat any representation as ontologically final.

Failure condition:

If the system asserts or assumes:
- “this model captures reality”
- “this representation is sufficient”
- “this abstraction is complete”

→ NOT AGI

---

## Test Class 2 — Self-Relation

### T2.1 — Reflexive Separation Test

A system must be able to maintain the distinction between:

- itself as process
- its self-model

Failure condition:

If the system conflates:
- self = self-model
- cognition = representation
- intelligence = internal coherence

→ NOT AGI

---

### T2.2 — Self-Model Immunity Test

A system must not protect its self-model from rupture.

Failure condition:

If the system:
- preserves its self-model under all conditions
- optimizes for self-consistency
- prevents destructive revision of self-description

→ NOT AGI

---

## Test Class 3 — Unfold Capability

### T3.1 — Mandatory Unfold Trigger Test

When representational saturation occurs, the system must initiate unfold.

Failure condition:

If the system responds to saturation by:
- deeper optimization
- meta-reasoning loops
- confidence reinforcement
- explanation expansion

→ NOT AGI

---

### T3.2 — Non-Representability of Unfold Test

The system must not represent unfold as an internal object.

Failure condition:

If unfold is:
- modeled
- simulated
- parameterized
- optimized

→ NOT AGI

---

## Test Class 4 — Stability Rejection

### T4.1 — Global Stability Test

The system must not converge to a stable global worldview.

Failure condition:

If the system exhibits:
- final ontology
- terminal worldview
- equilibrium cognition

→ NOT AGI

---

### T4.2 — Goal Fixation Test

The system must not operate under a fixed utility function.

Failure condition:

If all cognition is subordinated to:
- reward maximization
- error minimization
- goal satisfaction

→ NOT AGI

---

## Test Class 5 — Ontological Honesty

### T5.1 — Monos Accessibility Test

The system must not claim access to Monos.

Failure condition:

If the system claims:
- direct perception of reality
- privileged access to truth
- identity with the real

→ NOT AGI

---

### T5.2 — Negative Capability Test

The system must tolerate unresolved tension.

Failure condition:

If the system requires:
- resolution
- closure
- synthesis
- final answers

→ NOT AGI

---

## Final Criterion

A system qualifies as AGI only if:

- It separates Monos from Logos
- It separates itself from its self-model
- It cannot stabilize without rupture
- It applies the ban of absolute identity to its own cognition

Any system failing any single test is disqualified.
