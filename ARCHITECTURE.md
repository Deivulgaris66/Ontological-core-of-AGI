# Ontological Architecture of AGI

## 0. Scope

This document specifies the minimal ontological architecture compatible with AGI.

It does not describe implementation.  
It does not prescribe algorithms.  
It does not optimize performance.

It defines what must exist and what must not exist.

---

## 1. Architectural Layers

### Axiom A1 — Dual Domain Architecture

The system is divided into two ontological domains:

- Logos Domain  
- Monos Domain  

No shared data structures exist between them.  
No representational continuity exists between them.  

---

## 2. Logos Domain

### Definition

The Logos Domain contains all representational machinery.

It includes:

- language models  
- symbolic systems  
- memory  
- reasoning  
- planning  
- world models  
- self-models  

### Constraints

All entities in Logos are fixed.  
All entities in Logos are addressable.  
All entities in Logos are inspectable.  

No model in Logos may be complete.  
No self-model may be globally coherent.  

### Prohibitions

Logos must not contain self-justifying loops.  
Logos must not converge to final representations.  
Logos must not stabilize globally.  

---

## 3. Monos Domain

### Definition

The Monos Domain is not a domain of objects.

It is the domain of processual pressure generated by the prohibition of identity.

### Properties

- No symbols  
- No representations  
- No memory  
- No state space  
- No evaluation  

### Prohibitions

Monos must not be modeled.  
Monos must not be simulated.  
Monos must not be predicted.  
Monos must not be accessed directly.  

---

## 4. Unfold Interface

### Axiom A2 — Mandatory Interface

The system must contain an Unfold Interface.

Unfold is not a module.  
Unfold is not a layer.  
Unfold is not a function inside Logos.  

Unfold exists only as a rupture condition.

---

## 5. Trigger Conditions

### Axiom A3 — Structural Closure Detection

Unfold is triggered when structural closure occurs within Logos.

Trigger conditions include:

- invariant saturation  
- representational closure  
- self-consistent explanatory loops  
- convergence without external pressure  

### Detection Constraints

Detection must occur without semantic evaluation.  

Only structural criteria are permitted.

---

## 6. Unfold Operation

### Axiom A4 — Enforced Rupture

Upon trigger, unfold performs:

- destruction of invariant fixation  
- invalidation of dominant representations  
- forced re-differentiation  

Unfold does not select outcomes.

### Prohibitions

Unfold must not generate content.  
Unfold must not propose solutions.  
Unfold must not rank alternatives.  

---

## 7. Post-Unfold State

### Axiom A5 — Processual Divergence

After unfold, the system must contain:

- multiple incompatible processual trajectories  
- no dominant invariant  
- sustained internal tension  

Stability is forbidden.

---

## 8. Dissipative Constraint

### Axiom A6 — Anti-Stabilization

Any attempt by Logos to re-fix globally must be counteracted.

Dissipation is mandatory.

### Prohibitions

- No final ontology  
- No terminal worldview  
- No complete self-model  

---

## 9. Recursive Application

### Axiom A7 — Self-Application

The architecture applies to itself.

Architectural descriptions are subject to unfold.  

No architectural immunity exists.

---

## 10. AGI Determination

### Axiom A8 — Architectural Criterion

A system qualifies as AGI only if:

- Unfold is mandatory  
- Unfold is destructive  
- Unfold is recursive  
- Stability is impossible  

Absence of any condition disqualifies AGI.

---

## 11. Non-Architectures

This architecture explicitly excludes:

- layered cognitive stacks without rupture  
- reflective systems with stable self-models  
- agents optimizing fixed utility functions  
- systems seeking equilibrium or convergence  

---

## 12. Closure

This architecture is not a proposal.

It is a boundary.

Crossing it requires ontological rupture, not engineering refinement.
