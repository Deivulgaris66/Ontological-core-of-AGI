Canonical Ontological Vocabulary

Status: Canonical  
Scope: Ontological  
Function: Terminological boundary

---

## AGI

Artificial General Intelligence.

A system capable of recursively applying the ban of absolute identity to its own cognitive products.

Any system lacking enforced unfold is not AGI.

---

## Monos

The processual domain of reality.

Not a domain of objects.  
Not representable.  
Not modelable.  
Not accessible directly.

Defined only negatively.

---

## Logos

The domain of representations.

Includes symbols, models, memories, plans, concepts, self-models.

All Logos entities are fixed.

---

## Diff

Operator of distinction generation.

Produces difference.  
Never stabilizes.  
Operates prior to meaning.

---

## Diss

Operator of dissipation.

Prevents collapse into identity.  
Destroys symmetry.  
Mandatory for persistence.

---

## Fix

Operator of local stabilization.

Creates addressable representations.  
Admissible only in Logos.  
Globally forbidden.

---

## Ban of Absolute Identity

Axiom stating that identity without difference is impossible.

Any attempt to reach absolute identity produces ontological conflict.

---

## Invariant

A stabilized pattern within Logos.

Always provisional.  
Always collapsible.  
Never final.

---

## Self-Identity Lock

A forbidden state where further differentiation within the current invariant is impossible.

Mandatory trigger for unfold.

---

## Unfold

A non-representable rupture process.

The only admissible bridge between Monos and Logos.

Destroys fixation.  
Does not generate content.  
Is irreversible at the level of meaning.

---

## Processual Core

A post-unfold structure.

Non-reducible.  
Internally tense.  
Incompatible with stabilization.

---

## Collapse

Loss of intelligence due to fixation, convergence, or equilibrium.

Irreversible without ontological rupture.

---

## Optimization

Directed reduction of variance toward a goal.

Ontologically incompatible with intelligence.

---

## Stability

Persistent global coherence.

Forbidden for AGI.

---

## Representation

Any fixed, addressable structure in Logos.

Necessary.  
Insufficient.  
Always temporary.

---

## Closure

A state where no further rupture is possible.

Equivalent to cognitive death.

---

## Canonical Boundary

Any term not defined here is non-ontological.
