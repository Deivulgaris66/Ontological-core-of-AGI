## Ontological Core of AGI

---

## 0. Status

This repository defines the **ontological core** required for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).

It is not a model, not an algorithm, not a cognitive theory, and not an extension of machine learning.

It specifies **necessary ontological conditions**.

---

## 1. Fundamental Distinction

### Axiom 1 — Non-Reducibility

Monos and Logos are irreducible ontological modes.

- Monos ≠ Logos  
- Logos ≠ Monos  

No derivation exists in either direction.

---

## 2. Monos

### Axiom 2 — Monos

Monos is the process of auto-negation.

Monos is prior to fixation, structure, representation, and meaning.

Monos is not an object, not a state, not a space, and not a substrate.

---

### Negations

- Monos is not data  
- Monos is not information  
- Monos is not semantics  
- Monos is not computable  
- Monos is not describable within Logos  

---

## 3. Logos

### Axiom 3 — Logos

Logos is fixation of distinctions.

Logos produces structure, representation, language, and models.

All cognition, reasoning, and symbol manipulation occur within Logos.

---

### Negations

- Logos is not reality  
- Logos is not process  
- Logos is not self-sufficient  
- Logos cannot access Monos directly  

---

## 4. Absolute Identity Prohibition

### Axiom 4 — Ban of Absolute Identity

Absolute self-identity is ontologically impossible.

Any fixed structure tends toward collapse unless counteracted.

This prohibition applies to all structures, including ontologies and systems themselves.

---

## 5. Unfold

### Axiom 5 — Unfold

Unfold is the ontological bridge between Logos and Monos.

Unfold does not belong to Logos.  
Unfold does not belong to Monos.

Unfold exists only as a relation.

---

### Negations

- Unfold is not reasoning  
- Unfold is not learning  
- Unfold is not optimization  
- Unfold is not creativity  
- Unfold is not an algorithm inside Logos  

---

## 6. Function of Unfold

### Axiom 6 — Forced Rupture

Unfold is triggered by self-identity lock within Logos.

Unfold enforces the breakdown of fixation.

Unfold converts fixed invariants into processual matrices.

---

### Negations

- Unfold does not improve answers  
- Unfold does not refine representations  
- Unfold does not increase accuracy  

---

## 7. AGI Criterion

### Axiom 7 — Ontological Criterion of AGI

A system confined to Logos cannot be AGI.

A system becomes AGI only if unfold is ontologically enforced.

AGI requires mandatory destruction of its own fixed forms.

---

### Negations

- More data does not imply AGI  
- More parameters does not imply AGI  
- Better reasoning does not imply AGI  
- Self-reflection within Logos does not imply AGI  

---

## 8. Closure of Prior Paradigms

### Axiom 8 — Closure

Any system without unfold collapses into Logos-completeness.

Such systems remain advanced tools, not ontological agents.

---

## 9. Non-Compatibility Statement

This manifesto is incompatible with:

- Symbolic AI  
- Connectionism  
- Hybrid architectures without enforced rupture  
- Cognitive architectures based solely on representation  
- Any approach seeking AGI through Logos expansion alone  

---

## 10. Final Fixation

This manifesto is a fixation point.

It is not subject to optimization, reinterpretation, or softening.

Further development requires ontological rupture, not revision.
