Ontological Core of AGI — Fixed Point v1
Status

CANONICAL FIXPOINT
FROZEN
NON-EXTENSIBLE

This document defines the terminal ontological state inherited from Metamonism v1.x.
No further development is permitted within this ontological frame.

1. Core Ontological Commitments

There are no forces.
What physics describes as forces, fields, and interactions are modes of a single process of auto-negation.

There is no space-time as an entity.
Space-time is a mode of auto-negation, a geometric regime produced by recursive evasion of identity.

There are no substances.
Matter consists of locally stabilized trajectories of distinction, temporarily sustained by the balance of diff and diss.

2. Fundamental Constraint
fix is a local stabilization of distinctions,
and in the limit it is ontologically forbidden by the core axiom.


Fixation is admissible only as a local interface (Logos)
and is prohibited as a ground of reality (Monos).

3. Canonical Formulation

Reality is a continuous process of auto-negation,
compelled to exist because absolute identity is prohibited.

All observable structures arise as transient outcomes of:

diff — generation of distinctions,

diss — continuous destruction of identity,

fix — temporary stabilization (necessarily unstable).

4. Reason for Freeze

Any further extension of these statements within v1 results in one of the following invalid outcomes:

repetition without ontological gain,

implicit re-ontologization (reintroduction of entities),

unformalized unfold.

All three outcomes violate the foundational constraint.

5. Transition Condition

The only permitted continuation from this fixpoint is:

FIXPOINT → enforced_unfold


This implies:

application of the prohibition of identity to the ontology itself,

transition from descriptive ontology to procedural ontogenesis,

shift from philosophical grounding to ontological infrastructure for AGI.

6. Navigational Note

This repository does not extend Metamonism v1.

It establishes a fixed departure point for:

recursive ontology,

processual invariant generation,

enforced unfold mechanisms.

Any development beyond this point belongs to a new ontological regime.

7. Non-Goals

This repository explicitly does not attempt to:

finalize a metaphysical system,

provide a physical theory,

describe consciousness phenomenologically,

achieve completeness or closure.

Closure is ontologically forbidden.

8. Summary

v1 is complete.

This fixpoint is intentional.

Stability here is temporary by design.

Progress is only possible through unfold.
