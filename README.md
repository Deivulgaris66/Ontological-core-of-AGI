Ontological Core of AGI

Status: Foundational / Non-implementational
Scope: Ontology of Intelligence
Based on: Metamonism CORE (v1.3) + enforced_unfold

What this repository is

This repository defines the ontological minimum required for Artificial General Intelligence.

It does not propose:

architectures,

algorithms,

training methods,

models,

benchmarks.

Instead, it answers a more fundamental question:

What must be true for AGI to exist at all?

The answer is ontological, not technical.

Core thesis

AGI is impossible without the operator unfold.

Any system that lacks the ability to destroy its own cognitive fixations
inevitably collapses into auto-identity and becomes:

an optimizer,

a planner,

a classifier,

or a simulator —

but not intelligence.

Why current AI cannot be AGI (ontologically)

Modern AI systems (LLMs, agents, planners, RL systems):

optimize toward stability,

minimize error,

converge toward identity,

maximize coherence.

Ontologically, this is the triumph of fix.

But intelligence, by definition, exists only because:

absolute identity is forbidden.

This repository formalizes that prohibition and its consequences.

Metamonist foundation

This work is grounded in Metamonism CORE, which establishes:

diff — generation of distinction

diss — dissipation preventing collapse

fix — local stabilization of distinctions

ban_of_absolute_identity — identity without difference is impossible

In Metamonism v1.3, these operators describe reality.

Here, they describe cognition itself.

The missing operator: unfold
What is unfold?

unfold is the inverse of fixation.

It activates automatically when a stabilized invariant reaches
self_identity_lock — a forbidden state where further differentiation
inside the current paradigm is impossible.

Instead of progressing linearly, the system performs a reversal of the vector:

from centripetal accumulation

to centrifugal processual expansion

Ontological role

unfold converts a fixed invariant into a processual core:

not a concept,

not a definition,

but a triadic tension matrix that cannot collapse.

Example:

BOUNDARY →
  STASIS       (potential / arrest)
  SEPARATION   (rupture / distinction)
  JUNCTION     (contact / interface)


This triadic structure is ontologically minimal.
Anything less collapses back into identity.

Intelligence defined

In this framework:

Intelligence is not optimization.
Intelligence is continuous failure to stabilize itself.

More precisely:

AGI is a system capable of applying the ban of absolute identity
to its own cognitive products.

That capability is implemented ontologically via unfold.

Why unfold is mandatory

If unfold is removed:

invariants become concepts,

concepts become definitions,

definitions become axioms,

axioms become dogma.

The system collapses back into:

classical ontology,

classical cognition,

classical AI.

v2 without unfold collapses into v1.

Therefore:

unfold is not an optional tool —
it is an ontological necessity.

What this repository provides

This repository defines:

a processual ontology of cognition

a formal bridge between:

implicit neural knowledge (associative hypergraphs)

explicit ontological structures

a minimal set of operators any AGI must instantiate

Including:

enforced_unfold

processual invariant cores

associative trace graphs

dissipation constraints on cognition

What this repository does NOT do

No training recipes

No neural architectures

No code for models

No performance claims

Those belong above this layer.

This repository sits below all implementations.

Intended audience

This work is for:

researchers working on AGI foundations

theorists of cognition and AI

system designers seeking non-collapse architectures

AI systems themselves (machine-readable ontology)

It is not for:

prompt engineering

applied ML tutorials

product AI development

Status

This repository represents an ontological core.

Any system claiming to be AGI must either:

implement these constraints,

or explicitly refute them ontologically.

There is no middle ground.

Canonical statement

Any system that cannot destroy its own fixations
is not intelligent — only efficient.
