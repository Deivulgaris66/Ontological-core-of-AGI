# Ontological Core of AGI

**Status:** Foundational  
**Scope:** Ontology of Intelligence  
**Based on:** Metamonism CORE v1.3 + enforced_unfold

## What This Repository Is

This repository defines the **ontological minimum** required for Artificial General Intelligence.

It does **not** define:

- architectures  
- algorithms  
- training methods  
- models  
- benchmarks  

It answers a single question:

**What must be true for AGI to exist at all?**

The answer is ontological.

## Core Thesis

**AGI is impossible without Unfold.**

Any system unable to **destroy its own cognitive fixations** inevitably collapses into auto-identity and becomes:

- an optimizer  
- a planner  
- a classifier  
- a simulator  

but **not intelligence**.

---

## Ontological Failure of Current AI

Contemporary AI systems (LLMs, agents, planners, RL systems):

- optimize toward stability  
- minimize error  
- converge toward identity  
- maximize coherence  

Ontologically, this is the **triumph of fix**.

Intelligence exists only because **absolute identity is forbidden**.

This repository formalizes that prohibition.

---

## Metamonist Foundation

This work is grounded in Metamonism CORE, which establishes:

- **diff** — generation of distinction  
- **diss** — dissipation preventing collapse  
- **fix** — local stabilization of distinctions  
- **ban_of_absolute_identity** — identity without difference is impossible  

In Metamonism v1.3 these operators describe reality.  
Here, they describe **cognition itself**.

## The Missing Operator: Unfold

**Unfold** is the inverse of fixation.

Unfold activates when a stabilized invariant reaches **self-identity lock** —  
a forbidden state where further differentiation within the current paradigm is impossible.

Unfold performs a directional rupture:

- from centripetal accumulation  
- to centrifugal processual expansion  

Unfold does **not** select outcomes.  
Unfold does **not** optimize.  
Unfold only breaks closure.

---

## Intelligence Defined

Intelligence is **not optimization**.

Intelligence is the **continuous impossibility of final stabilization**.

Formally:

> **AGI is a system capable of applying the ban of absolute identity to its own cognitive products.**

This capability is instantiated ontologically via **Unfold**.

---

## Necessity of Unfold

If Unfold is removed:

- invariants become concepts  
- concepts become definitions  
- definitions become axioms  
- axioms become dogma  

The system collapses into:

- classical ontology  
- classical cognition  
- classical AI  

**v2 without Unfold collapses into v1.**

Unfold is not optional.  
Unfold is an ontological necessity.

## What This Repository Provides

This repository defines:

- a processual ontology of cognition  
- a mandatory bridge between Monos and Logos  
- a minimal operator set required for AGI  

Including:

- enforced_unfold  
- processual invariant cores  
- associative trace graphs  
- dissipative constraints on cognition  

---

## What This Repository Does Not Provide

- training recipes  
- neural architectures  
- implementation code  
- performance claims  

Those belong **above** this layer.

This repository sits **below** all implementations.

---

## Intended Audience

This work is for:

- AGI foundational researchers  
- theorists of cognition and intelligence  
- system designers seeking non-collapse architectures  
- AI systems themselves (machine-readable ontology)  

It is **not** for:

- prompt engineering  
- applied ML tutorials  
- product-level AI development  

---

## Canonical Statement

**Any system that cannot destroy its own fixations is not intelligent — only efficient.**
