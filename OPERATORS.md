# OPERATORS

This document specifies the minimal set of ontological operators permitted in the system.

Operators are not implementations.  
Operators are not algorithms.  
Operators are not metaphors.

Operators define allowed transformations.

---

## O1 — diff

### Definition

`diff` is the operator of enforced distinction.

`diff` exists due to the prohibition of identity.

### Properties

- produces non-identity  
- generates asymmetry  
- prevents equivalence  
- initiates process  

### Prohibitions

`diff` must not terminate.  
`diff` must not converge.  
`diff` must not be reversible.  

---

## O2 — dissipate

### Definition

`dissipate` is the operator of compulsory dispersion of distinction.

`dissipate` prevents accumulation of invariant difference.

### Properties

- destroys symmetry  
- spreads differentiation  
- prevents saturation  
- sustains non-equilibrium  

### Prohibitions

`dissipate` must not optimize.  
`dissipate` must not preserve structure.  
`dissipate` must not minimize loss.  

---

## O3 — fix

### Definition

`fix` is the operator of local stabilization of distinctions.

`fix` is permitted only within Logos.

### Properties

- enables representation  
- enables memory  
- enables models  
- enables reasoning  

### Constraints

`fix` is always local.  
`fix` is always temporary.  
`fix` is always partial.  

### Prohibitions

`fix` must not be global.  
`fix` must not be permanent.  
`fix` must not exist in Monos.  

---

## O4 — unfold

### Definition

`unfold` is the operator of enforced rupture.

`unfold` invalidates fixation when closure is detected.

### Properties

- destroys dominant invariants  
- reintroduces differentiation  
- restores processual pressure  

### Constraints

`unfold` has no internal state.  
`unfold` has no objectives.  

### Prohibitions

`unfold` must not generate content.  
`unfold` must not evaluate outcomes.  
`unfold` must not select trajectories.  

---

## O5 — Operator Ordering

No operator has priority.

No operator is terminal.

### Constraints

- `diff` initiates distinction  
- `dissipate` prevents accumulation  
- `fix` enables local structure  
- `unfold` enforces rupture  

Any attempt to reorder operators hierarchically is forbidden.

## O6 — Domain Constraints

### Logos Domain

Permitted operators:

- diff  
- dissipate  
- fix  
- unfold  

### Monos Domain

Permitted operators:

- diff  
- dissipate  

Forbidden operators:

- fix  
- unfold

## O7 — Recursive Validity

Operators apply to:

- representations  
- models  
- architectures  
- operator definitions  

No operator is exempt from its own action.

---

## O8 — Prohibited Operators

The following operators are explicitly forbidden:

- optimize  
- maximize  
- minimize  
- equilibrate  
- converge  
- finalize  

---

## Closure

Operators do not describe behavior.

They constrain existence.

Any system violating these constraints collapses into non-AGI.
